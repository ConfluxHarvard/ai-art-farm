7. Create or select a prompt.

      1. Choose "Main Models" if you only want to see our main fine-tune models.
      2. Choose "All Models" if you want to see all available models.
   2. Choose a generation type:
      1. Choose "Single" Generation" if you only want to test one set of parameters.
      2. Choose "Parameter Exploration" if you want to test multiple sets parameters at once.
   3. Choose a model / models. **WARNING**: You must select models that are in the ['Model_Info_AIArt'](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yDQSiFq9mISp5Sj5L7ttbe-MvF-Ss7dRPeLTskGJKn8/edit) sheet if you want to auto-format.
   4. Adjust other parameters as desired.
9. Click "Run Exploration" to generate your data.
10. All data is stored in the [AIArt_Data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KSkYR-slxPeixz8QiHdfBXZcTS4uP9Ga?usp=sharing).
    1.  You can access your data in Superminds_{your name}_Database and the team data in [AIArt_Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DIG-XlFJYanX2PJwDCBsmR4557TbEMr7EkqoiEZcLWc/edit#gid=839321072).
